# The Anti-Leader: A Missing Piece

Back in 2018, I wrote about a pattern I had seen repeatedly in organizations: the anti-leader.

An anti-leader is not simply an imperfect manager. Every leader has blind spots. An anti-leader is someone whose habits actively weaken the people and systems around them. They slow growth, suppress trust, and make it harder for an organization to adapt.

At the time, I focused on three common versions of the anti-leader: the "my way" type, the control freak, and the blame manager.

Looking back, I missed a fourth type. In some ways, it may be the most damaging of all.

The "it's about me" leader.

## The First Three Anti-Leaders

The first three still show up everywhere, and they are worth naming clearly because they do real damage.

### 1. The "My Way" Type

These leaders believe they are the smartest person in the room, and they act like it.

They insist work must be done their way because their experience, expertise, or past success has convinced them they already know the best answer. Sometimes they truly are highly skilled in one area, but they make the mistake of treating that expertise as universal authority.

The problem is not that they have standards. The problem is that they confuse "different" with "wrong."

When a leader shuts down every new approach, they do more than frustrate people. They train the organization to stop thinking. New ideas get filtered out before they are tested. Team members stop bringing forward improvements because they already know how the conversation will end.

That kind of leadership creates stagnation. It is one of the fastest ways for a company to go from leading a market to chasing one.

### 2. The Control Freak

Control freaks may say they value input, but in practice they need every decision, every handoff, and every action to run through them.

They micromanage because they do not trust others to carry responsibility without constant oversight. Some believe this protects quality. In reality, it limits the team to only what one person can personally watch and approve.

That creates a ceiling.

Small teams can sometimes survive under this model for a while, especially if the leader is highly capable. But growth exposes the weakness quickly. People do not develop. Future leaders never get room to emerge. Bottlenecks multiply. Burnout follows.

An organization cannot scale if one person insists on being the center of every moving part.

### 3. The Blame Manager

When something goes wrong, blame managers immediately look for who to fault instead of what to fix.

They focus on assigning responsibility before they understand the cause. They often interpret problems as proof of someone else's incompetence rather than signs of missing resources, unclear expectations, poor timing, weak process design, or conflicting priorities.

That approach changes the behavior of everyone around them.

People start protecting themselves instead of solving problems. They avoid risk. They hide mistakes. They say less, try less, and learn less. Eventually, innovation gives way to caution, and the organization falls behind not because people are incapable, but because they have been trained to operate in fear.

## The Missing Fourth Type

The fourth anti-leader is different because the damage is often less dramatic at first. It can look ordinary, even subtle.

This leader uses their position primarily to make their own life easier.

They build schedules around their convenience. They delegate unpleasant work downward without much thought. They expect flexibility from others while protecting it for themselves. They use authority to secure comfort, not to create clarity, growth, or support for the team.

This is the "it's about me" leader.

And unlike the other three, I do not only recognize this type from observation.

I recognize it because, at 16 years old, I was that leader.

## The Lesson I Learned at 16

When I was 16, I managed a small snack bar at a country club. It was a simple operation with a team of three, including me.

I handled the schedule, and I made it work for my needs. I did not ask the other two what they needed. I did not think much about fairness. I did not think about what it meant to lead. I simply treated the small amount of authority I had as a tool to make my own life easier.

Then came the moment that exposed what I had built.

Later, I needed flexibility from the other two. I needed them to adjust. I needed them to help carry the load.

Instead, they mirrored exactly what I had modeled. They did what worked for them and nothing more.

At the time, it felt frustrating. In hindsight, it was completely predictable.

They had learned from me that the arrangement was transactional and self-serving. I had made it clear, through my own behavior, that each person should look out for their own interests first. When I needed something different, I had no foundation to stand on.

That was an early lesson, but it was one of the most important leadership lessons I ever learned:

Leadership is not about arranging things around your own needs. It is about understanding and serving the needs of the people you are responsible for.

## People Follow the Example You Set

One of the most consistent truths in leadership is that people take their cue from the behavior they see.

If the leader makes everything about themselves, the team will do the same.

If the leader hoards flexibility, information, credit, or convenience, others will respond in kind. They may not say it out loud, but they will adapt to the example in front of them. They will protect their own interests first because that is what the system is teaching them to do.

On the other hand, if the leader consistently makes decisions with the team in mind, people notice that too. They become more willing to step up, help one another, stretch when needed, and think beyond their own narrow responsibilities.

Culture is not built mainly through slogans or values statements. It is built through repeated examples, especially from the people with authority.

That is why the "it's about me" leader can be so destructive. This type of leader normalizes self-interest at the top, and that behavior spreads quickly.

Organizations where everyone is looking out only for themselves do not grow well. They do not innovate well. They do not build trust well. And over time, they get passed by.

## Why This Type Can Be the Most Damaging

The "my way" leader stifles ideas. The control freak slows growth. The blame manager creates fear.

The self-focused leader does something broader: they corrode the social contract that makes teams function.

They turn leadership into a personal perk instead of a responsibility.

Once that happens, trust starts to thin out. Discretionary effort disappears. People stop offering the extra thought, extra care, and extra initiative that healthy organizations depend on. Not because they are lazy, but because they are responding rationally to the example they have been given.

I have seen this pattern in multiple organizations over the years, and the outcome is consistent. Innovation drops. Hard work becomes more transactional. Teams become less resilient. People become less invested in one another and in the larger mission.

That is why I now see this fourth anti-leader as a missing piece in the original framework.

## The Standard Real Leaders Must Meet

Good leadership does not mean ignoring your own needs. It does mean understanding that leadership is not fundamentally about you.

It is about building the conditions for other people to do strong work, grow in capability, and trust the system they are part of.

That requires fairness. It requires self-awareness. It requires the discipline to ask not only, "What works best for me?" but also, "What example am I setting?" and "What does this decision teach the people around me?"

If your authority mainly makes your own life easier, you are not really leading. You are consuming the trust that leadership depends on.

## Final Thought

Sometimes the most valuable leadership lessons do not come from a management book or a training course.

Sometimes they come from recognizing where we got it wrong.

That 16-year-old version of me taught me something I have never forgotten: people will usually follow the example their leader sets, for better or worse.

If you make leadership about yourself, the people around you will do the same.

If you make leadership about the people you serve, you give the organization a chance to grow, trust, and lead.
