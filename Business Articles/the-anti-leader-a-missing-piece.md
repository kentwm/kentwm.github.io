# The Anti-Leader: A Missing Piece

Back in 2018, I wrote about a pattern I had seen repeatedly in organizations: the anti-leader.

An anti-leader is not simply an imperfect manager. Every leader has blind spots. An anti-leader is someone whose habits actively weaken the people and systems around them. They slow growth, suppress trust, and make it harder for an organization to adapt.

At the time, I focused on three common versions of the anti-leader: the "my way" type, the control freak, and the blame manager.

Looking back, I missed a fourth type. In some ways, it may be the most damaging of all.

The "it's about me" leader.

## The First Three Still Matter

The first three still show up everywhere, and each of them damages an organization in a predictable way.

### 1. The "My Way" Type

These leaders insist work must be done their way because they believe their past success gives them the best answer in every situation. The problem is not high standards. The problem is confusing "different" with "wrong." When leaders shut down every alternative approach, they train people to stop thinking, and the organization gradually stagnates.

### 2. The Control Freak

Control freaks may invite input, but they still need every decision and every handoff to run through them. They mistake constant oversight for quality control, when in reality they are limiting the team to what one person can monitor. That creates a hard ceiling: people do not develop, bottlenecks multiply, and growth slows because the organization cannot scale around a leader who must control everything.

### 3. The Blame Manager

When something goes wrong, blame managers look for who to fault before they understand what failed. They treat problems as evidence of personal incompetence instead of checking for missing resources, unclear expectations, or weak process design. Over time, that creates a culture of fear. People protect themselves instead of solving problems, and innovation gives way to caution.

## The Missing Fourth Type

The fourth anti-leader is different because the damage is often less dramatic at first. It can look ordinary, even subtle.

This leader uses their position primarily to make their own life easier.

They build schedules around their convenience. They push unpleasant work downward without much thought. They expect flexibility from others while protecting it for themselves. They use authority to secure comfort, not to create clarity, growth, or support for the team.

This is the "it's about me" leader.

And unlike the other three, I do not only recognize this type from observation.

I recognize it because, at 16 years old, I was that leader.

## The Lesson I Learned at 16

When I was 16, I managed a small snack bar at a country club. It was a simple operation with a team of three, including me.

I handled the schedule, and I made it work for my needs. I did not ask the other two what they needed. I was not thinking about fairness or leadership. I was simply using the small amount of authority I had to make my own life easier.

Then, eventually, I needed flexibility from them.

Instead, they mirrored exactly what I had modeled. They did what worked for them and nothing more.

At the time, it felt frustrating. In hindsight, it was completely predictable.

They had learned from me that the arrangement was transactional and self-serving. I had made it clear, through my own behavior, that each person should look out for their own interests first. When I needed something different, I had no foundation to stand on.

That was an early lesson, but it was one of the most important leadership lessons I ever learned:

Leadership is not about arranging things around your own needs. It is about understanding and serving the needs of the people you are responsible for.

## Why This Type Is So Damaging

One of the most consistent truths in leadership is that people take their cue from the behavior they see.

If the leader makes everything about themselves, the team will do the same.

If the leader hoards flexibility, information, credit, or convenience, others will respond in kind. They may not say it out loud, but they will adapt to the example in front of them. They will protect their own interests first because that is what the system is teaching them to do.

On the other hand, if the leader consistently makes decisions with the team in mind, people notice that too. They become more willing to step up, help one another, stretch when needed, and think beyond their own narrow responsibilities.

Culture is not built mainly through slogans or values statements. It is built through repeated examples, especially from the people with authority.

That is why the "it's about me" leader can be so destructive. The "my way" leader stifles ideas. The control freak slows growth. The blame manager creates fear. But the self-focused leader does something broader: they normalize self-interest at the top and corrode the social contract that makes teams function.

Once that happens, trust starts to thin out. Discretionary effort disappears. People stop offering the extra thought, extra care, and extra initiative that healthy organizations depend on. Not because they are lazy, but because they are responding rationally to the example they have been given.

I have seen this pattern in multiple organizations over the years, and the outcome is consistent. Innovation drops. Hard work becomes more transactional. Teams become less resilient. People become less invested in one another and in the larger mission.

That is why I now see this fourth anti-leader as the missing piece in the original framework.

## The Standard Real Leaders Must Meet

Good leadership does not mean ignoring your own needs. It does mean understanding that leadership is not fundamentally about you.

It is about building the conditions for other people to do strong work, grow in capability, and trust the system they are part of.

That requires fairness. It requires self-awareness. It requires the discipline to ask not only, "What works best for me?" but also, "What example am I setting?" and "What does this decision teach the people around me?"

If your authority mainly makes your own life easier, you are not really leading. You are consuming the trust that leadership depends on.

## Final Thought

Sometimes the most valuable leadership lessons do not come from a management book or a training course.

Sometimes they come from recognizing where we got it wrong.

That 16-year-old version of me taught me something I have never forgotten: people will usually follow the example their leader sets, for better or worse.

If you make leadership about yourself, the people around you will do the same.

If you make leadership about the people you serve, you give the organization a chance to grow, trust, and lead.
